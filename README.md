This will be a swift-ui based app that will gather gps, compass, etc information. It will optionally log it, and allow you to review it in the future. 
The data will be stored on the local device. It is up to the user to back it up, or use cloud storage if they want to keep it.

The intent is to put it on the app store for 0.99. Full featured and no ads.
